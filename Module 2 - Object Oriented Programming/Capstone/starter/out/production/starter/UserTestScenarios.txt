TEST WHEN USER

1. Sells before buying anything.  Says trade is unsuccessful.
2. Makes incorrect stock entry.  Asks you to keep entering a stock until you pick from one of the enums.
3. Makes negative number share entry for buying and selling. Keeps prompting user until integer is entered.
4. User tries to buy fraction of share. User is prompted until whole share is entered.
5. Test that user can't buy any more stocks when balance is 0.  Next trade is unsuccessful if balance is 0.
6. Test stopping as very first operation.  With changes in code, this test no longer makes sense.
