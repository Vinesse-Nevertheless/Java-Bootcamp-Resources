# Quidditch Game

End of chapter challenge exercise that simulates a Quidditch match between the Gryffindor and Slytherin teams.

                              GAME CLASS

There are two teams in a Quidditch game.
During the game, a scoreboard keeps track of every team's points.
The Game class receives plays from plays.txt.
It finds each placeholder and replaces it with a player from a random team.
If the placeholder is <chaser>, then update a team's Quaffle points.
If the placeholder is <seeker>, then update a team's Snitch points.
Scoring the "Quaffle" is worth 10 points and catching the "Snitch" is worth 150 points.

                              TEAM CLASS 

Every team is identified by their "house".
Each team has: 1 "keeper", 1 "seeker", and 3 "chasers". 
(For the sake of brevity, not all positions were included)

Creates tests that test the business logic of the Game class and the Team class.
